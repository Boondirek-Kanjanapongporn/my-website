    , description:'Build On, Asean is a Hackathon Competition sponsored by Amazon AWS and Depa to \
        encourage young inventors to solve modern problems through coding. For this competition, \
        our idea came from an era where working from home is the standard and the work environment \
        has become more accommodative than ever before. But despite this great opportunity, most of the \
        handicapped are still unable to find work due to being bedridden or the lack of essential physical \
        requirements needed to fulfill most jobs. So, our team created \"FILL\"— a non-profit transport/delivery \
        application for the disabled people. FILL concept is to offer deliveries and transportations remotely to support \
        the work opportunities for the handicapped. FILL uses remotely control vehicles such as drones to provide various transportation services. \
        Because all vehicles are remotely controlled, physical requirements are not much needed. In other words, \
        the disabled can work —using controllers— as the pilot all the while being bedridden. During the competition, \
        our team created a User-inferface prototype of how FILL works and will looks like in the market. In the end, \
        we won the Runner-up prize for this idea'

    , description:'Smart-City 2021 is a Hackathon Competition sponsored by Amazon AWS, Depa, and KrungThai to \
        help solve real-current problems. In this competition, our idea\'s inspiration came from the Covid-19 virus. \
        During that time, in Thailand, the count of Covid-19 infectors are increasing greatly everyday. So we \
        want to create an application that can help reduce the counts. So we introduced \"Divoc\", which \
        is a Covid-19 danger tracking application for Thai users. What it does is that it takes the timeline places\
        of Covid-19 victims, by hospitals, to distribute to the mass. Divoc will mark Covid-19 areas with red pin \
        so that other people knows which places to avoid if possible. If the user click on the red pin, there will be \
        a timer display of the latest Covid case infected from that might have been infected from that area. \
        Furthermore, Divoc has an additional feature called Red-zones in which if it detects highly dense areas, it will \
        send warnings to Divoc users in nearby areas. In the end, we won the Popular vote for the idea.'
